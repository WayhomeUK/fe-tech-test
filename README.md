# Front end tech test

## Set up

Git clone this repo

In the project directory, run:

### `yarn start`

## The challenge

In `src/locations/data/location-data` there is an array of locations imported into `Locations`.

The brief is to use this array of locations to

1. get all the counties used in the locations
2. group each location by its country
3. list the counties with it's towns on the page

Example:

```
- Bedfordshire

  - Leighton Buzzard
  - Ascot
  - Bracknell

- Hampshire

  - Blackwater
  - Tadley
  - Farnborough

- Yorkshire
  - Harrogate
  - Leeds
  - Yeadon
```

Bonus: render the counties and their towns in alphabetical order.
