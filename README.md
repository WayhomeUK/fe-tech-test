# Front end tech test

## Getting set up

Clone down this repo to your computer

In the project directory, run:

`yarn start`

## The brief

In `src/locations/data/location-data` there is an array of locations imported into `Locations`

The brief is to use this array of locations to group each location by its county and list in the `Locations` component.

Example

- Bedfordshire

  - Ascot
  - Bracknell
  - Leighton Buzzard

- Hampshire

  - Blackwater
  - Farnborough
  - Tadley

- Yorkshire
  - Harrogate
  - Leeds
  - Yeadon

Bonus: render the counties and their towns in alphabetical order.

Note:

- No styling/ CSS work is needed
- The Locations component is already displayed on the page
